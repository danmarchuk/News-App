# NewsApp


News app is an app which uses XML and Java to create an application for displaying news fetched from guardian API via JSON. This project was created to test my knowledge in:

  - Creating layous
  - Parsing the JSON response and convert it into text visible to the user
  - Creating my custom adapter in `NewsAdapter.java` and custom class - `News.java
  - Connecting to an API
  - Handling error cases gracefully
  - Updating information regularly
  - Using an AsyncTask
  - Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
  - Using Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL


### Installation

NewsApp requires [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) v 3.6.3 to run.
