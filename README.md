# NewsApp


The goal was to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the Internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. In the most recent portion of the Android Nanodegree program, I worked to build the News app. Along the way, I learned about connecting to the Internet in Android, parsing responses from an API, updating the information in my app, and properly displaying that information. Practicing these skills is imperative in order to build apps that delight and surprise users by anticipating their needs and supplying them with relevant information.
This project was created to test my knowledge in:

  - Creating layous
  - Parsing the JSON response and convert it into text visible to the user
  - Creating my custom adapter in `NewsAdapter.java` and custom class - `News.java`
  - Connecting to an API
  - Handling error cases gracefully
  - Updating information regularly
  - Using an AsyncTask
  - Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
  - Using Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL


### Installation

NewsApp requires [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) v 3.6.3 to run.
